# simplement

Radically simple implementations of stuff

Why? Powerful libraries with complex API's, abstractions, and DSL's are great when you need them, but not when you don't (and at first you usually don't). Using these such libraries is without a doubt preferable to rolling your own complex implementations, but simple V1 behavior is usually perfectly achievable in a relative few simple lines of code. That's what you'll find here. The simpler the better.

Implementations are ordered by category like on [The Ruby Toolbox](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/), with super simple code alternatives to the popular gems associated with those categories.
